I separate this section from the statistics one because when I needed to learn how to run statistics in R, I would feel frustrated when the documents I found were not directly telling me about specific tests I need to learn about.
It may not be generalizable but it makes sense to me now.
Sorry!

## [Using the tidyverse with Databases](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

By [Vebash Naidoo](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/)

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** You know R, especially the dplyr üì¶.
Even though the dplyr üì¶ is so well written to mimic the SQL syntax - select(), group_by(), left_join() etc. there is still a cognitive load when you switch between using R syntax, and SQL syntax (ask me, who has often written == in SQL syntax on Athena only to wonder why I am getting an error ü§ê).

You only have so much memory in your local environment, and may want your RDBMS to do the heavy lifting (most of the computation), and only pull data into R when you need to (e.g. pull in aggregated data to create plots for a report).

In this tutorial you will learn how to use dbplyr, which is a database back-end of dplyr, to execute queries directly in your RDBMS all the while writing R tidyverse syntax üòÆ ‚≠ê.
