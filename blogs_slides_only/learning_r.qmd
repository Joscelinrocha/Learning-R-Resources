**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** "This is a gentle introduction to the tidymodels package (which, like the tidyverse, is actually a collection of packages), and in order to examine various functions and capabilities of those packages, we'll build two very simple models, using easily available NHL data, and go over a few ways to evaluate them".
