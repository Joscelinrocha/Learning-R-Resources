## [Using GitHub Actions to Build your Hugo Website](https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2021-03-23-using-github-actions-to-build-your-hugo-website/)

Added Sun June 6th 2021

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** What we want is Github Actions to run certain
operations on a set schedule, build our website with hugo, and then
trigger a Netlify deployment. In particular, we want to render the
content/about.Rmd and knit my CV which is located in
content/about/resume/am_mowinckel_cv.Rmd, and not commit these to git,
just have them rendered right before Hugo build
