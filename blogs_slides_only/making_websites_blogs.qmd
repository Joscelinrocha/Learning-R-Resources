## [Making shareable documents with Quarto](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/)

By
[Openscapes](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/#about)

Added Sun April 30th 2023

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** This is a 1-hour tutorial that can be used to
teach or as self-paced learning.

We introduce Quarto by exploring this tutorial website, and practicing
the basic Quarto workflow using different tools (GitHub browser,
RStudio, and Jupyter) for editing your website.

We\'ll start off from the browser so you don\'t need to install any
additional software, however this approach is very limited and you will
soon outgrow its capabilities. If you don\'t already have a workflow to
edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio.
You don\'t need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor
features that make for happy workflows.

## [Using GitHub Actions to Build your Hugo Website](https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2021-03-23-using-github-actions-to-build-your-hugo-website/)

Added Sun June 6th 2021

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** What we want is Github Actions to run certain
operations on a set schedule, build our website with hugo, and then
trigger a Netlify deployment. In particular, we want to render the
content/about.Rmd and knit my CV which is located in
content/about/resume/am_mowinckel_cv.Rmd, and not commit these to git,
just have them rendered right before Hugo build
