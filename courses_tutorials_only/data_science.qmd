## [Data Science for Economists Seminar](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures#data-science-for-economists)

By [Grant McDermott at the University of Oregon](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures#data-science-for-economists)

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** This is a graduate economics seminar taught by Grant McDermott at the University of Oregon.

Please read the syllabus before you go through any of the lectures.
This will detail software requirements and installation, and give you a better sense of the aims and scope of the course.
I also have an "FAQ" section at the end that covers frequently asked questions (or, at least, potentially asked questions).
Speaking of which, here follow answers to some questions that are more specifically related to this repo.

## [Data Science for Psychologists: A Refreshed Exploratory & Graphical Data Analysis in R](https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/)

By [S. Mason Garrison](https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/)

Added Fri Apr 28th, 2023

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrison's Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P).
DS4P is a graduate-level quantitative methods course at Wake Forest University.
This class assumes zero knowledge of programming, computer science, linear algebra, probability, or really anything fancy.
I encourage anyone who is quant-curious to work their way through these course notes.
The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs.

## [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/)

By [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel](https://datasciencebox.org/)

**What is it?**\
**Excerpt from site: T**he core content of the course focuses on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, inference, modelling, and effective communication of results.
Time permitting, the course also introduces additional concepts and tools like interactive visualization and reporting, text analysis, and Bayesian inference.

## [Data Skill for Reproducible science](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/)

**What is it?**\
**Excerpt from site:** This course provides an overview of skills needed for reproducible research and open science using the statistical programming language R.
Students will learn about data visualisation, data tidying and wrangling, archiving, iteration and functions, probability and data simulations, general linear models, and reproducible workflows.
Learning is reinforced through weekly assignments that involve working with different types of data.

## [Data Wrangling in the Tidyverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOpb3VsWmck) 

By [Nick Huntington-Klein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOpb3VsWmck)

Date added Fri AprMay 5th, 2023

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from the site:** This video series covers the basics of data wrangling using the tidyverse, aimed at my data communications class.
I assume some very, very basic R background, but really not much.


This is a simplified and adapted version of my data wrangling workshops, which are available in full on my channel for tidyverse (R), data.table (R), and pandas (Python).
