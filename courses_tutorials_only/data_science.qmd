## [Data Science for Economists Seminar](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures#data-science-for-economists)

By [Grant McDermott at the University of Oregon](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures#data-science-for-economists)

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** This is a graduate economics seminar taught by Grant McDermott at the University of Oregon.

Please read the syllabus before you go through any of the lectures.
This will detail software requirements and installation, and give you a better sense of the aims and scope of the course.
I also have an "FAQ" section at the end that covers frequently asked questions (or, at least, potentially asked questions).
Speaking of which, here follow answers to some questions that are more specifically related to this repo.

## [Data Science for Psychologists: A Refreshed Exploratory & Graphical Data Analysis in R](https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/)

By [S. Mason Garrison](https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/)

Added Fri Apr 28th, 2023

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrison\'s Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P).
DS4P is a graduate-level quantitative methods course at Wake Forest University.
This class assumes zero knowledge of programming, computer science, linear algebra, probability, or really anything fancy.
I encourage anyone who is quant-curious to work their way through these course notes.
The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs.
