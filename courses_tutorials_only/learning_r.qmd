## [A gentle crash course in R using tidyverse](https://osf.io/69gub/) ðŸŒ±

By: Nicholas M. Michalak & Loek Brinkman

**What is this?** Description from site: In this three-hour workshop, we introduce you to data science in the R programming language. In particular, we'll show you how to use the "tidyverse" package to transform, visualize and model data. The workshop consists of short introductory presentations followed by elaborate hands-on sessions. At the end of each section, we'll showcase more complex features and functionality. The workshop is designed as an introduction to R. Zero programming experience is required. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a "feel" for what R is and what it can do for you, and we'll provide resources for follow-up self-study.

## [Fundamentals of R Workshop Materials\_](https://osf.io/a2x7j/)ðŸŒ±

By [Elizabeth Page-Gould & Alexander Danvers](https://osf.io/a2x7j/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** Have you been meaning to start using R for analysis? Have you been wondering how R can make your analysis easier and your research reproducible? We present a practical introduction to R, demonstrating core analyses in psychology research (e.g., ANOVA, regression). We also explain how to manipulate and clean data in R to maintain a precise record of how the data went from raw to analysis-ready. The ideal audience for this workshop is a researcher who has not used R before, has used it briefly and then gone back to SPSS for the final analyses, or who has used R a few times but wants a better grounding in the basics.

## [Modelling and visualizing data using R: A practical introduction](https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/r-modelling/)

By [Daniel Nettle](https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/r-modelling/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This is a basic overview of using R for data analysis, and of linear statistical modelling. It would be suitable for anyone who has had some stats training but not used R; or has used R a little but not become confident; or has neither had stats training nor used R but is not happy with a reasonably steep learning curve. The emphasis is on rapidly getting to be able to use R for most of the common practical purposes, and knowing that you can take it further should you need to. It is designed for you to be able to work through on your own.

## [Programming with R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

By [The Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This lesson is written as an introduction to R, but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming: how to solve problems by building functions, each of which can fit in a programmer's working memory. In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the "other 90%" of the language as well.
