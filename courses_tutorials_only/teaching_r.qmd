Here I added resources aimed exclusively for other people who are teaching R.

## [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/)

By [Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](https://datasciencebox.org/)

**What is it?**

**Excerpt from site:** The core content of the course focuses on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, inference, modelling, and effective communication of results.
Time permitting, the course also introduces additional concepts and tools like interactive visualization and reporting, text analysis, and Bayesian inference.
Data Science in a Box contains the materials required to teach (or learn from) the course described above, all of which are freely-available and open-source.
They include course materials such as slide decks, homework assignments, guided labs, sample exams, a final project assignment, as well as materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and course logistics.

## [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/)

**What is it?**

**Excerpt from website:** The psyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology and Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology has successfully made the transition to teaching reproducible research using R across all undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
Our curriculum now emphasizes essential 'data science' graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports.
Students learn about probability and inference through data simulation as well as by working with real datasets.

This website contains our open materials for teaching reproducible research.

## [Sharing on Short Notice_How to get your teaching materials online with R Markdown](https://rstudio-education.github.io/sharing-short-notice/#1)

By [Desirée De Leon & Alison Hill](https://rstudio-education.github.io/sharing-short-notice/#1)

**What is it?**

Now that many of us have to move to online platforms, this is a wonderful resource that walks you through on how you can use rMarkdown to upload your class materials.

## [Teaching Research Methods in R](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/rminrinpsy.html)

**What is it?**

**Excerpt from site:** This is a crowd-sourced list of uses of R to teach research methods in Psychology, and a link to Creative Commons teaching materials, where these are available.
The year teaching in R was adopted at undergraduate and postgraduate level is also recorded, where known.
Where there are no materials, but the organization's name has a link, this is a link to evidence that R is used.

**What is it?**

Tidy Data Tutor lets you write R and Tidyverse code in your browser and see how your data frame changes at each step of a data analysis pipeline.
(If you use Python, check out Pandas Tutor.)
