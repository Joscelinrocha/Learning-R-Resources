Added Thu Dec 31st, 2020

**What is this?**

Welcome to the second course in the Educational Data Science Specialization taught at the University of Oregon through the College of Education.
This course will be taught through R, a free and open-source statistical computing environment, and will provide students with the foundational principles and practice of data visualization, particularly as applied to scientific and technical data.
We will have weekly lectures, covering a wide variety of topics including human perception, color theory, and principles of visual design.
We will also cover mediums for communication across diverse audiences with an emphasis on different web applications.
Weekly hands-on laboratory sessions provide students the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice.

## [Data visualisation using R, for researchers who don't use R](https://psyteachr.github.io/introdataviz/)ðŸ’¯

Added Fri Feb 18th, 2022

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualisation using R, specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R.
First we detail the rationale for using R for data visualisation and introduce the "grammar of graphics" that underlies data visualisation using the ggplot2 package.
The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software such as histograms and boxplots, as well as showing how the code for these "basic" plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options such as violin-boxplots.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** In this talk, I present my favorite tips and tricks with regard to the ggplot2 package, a library for plotting in the programming language R.
I will cover functions that are helpful but many may not be aware of as well as a collection of interesting functions from a large range of extension packages.
The talk is intended for people who already know how to code in R and ggplot2.
However, I am going to cover a diverse collection of tips so I hope everyone can pick something helpful independent from their level of expertise.

## [How to Increase Legend Key Size in ggplot2](https://datavizpyr.com/increase-legend-key-size-in-ggplot2/)

By [datavizpyr](https://datavizpyr.com/increase-legend-key-size-in-ggplot2/)

Added Fri Apr 14th, 2023

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from article:** In this tutorial, we will learn how to increase the color legendâ€™s point (or legend key) size in ggplot2. Often when you make a plot with multiple groups and large number of data points, the legend key for the color variable are small and can be not legible in the plot.

Here we will see examples of increasing the point size of the legend in a scatter plot using guides() function in ggplot2.

Themes can be used to give plots a consistent customized look.
Modify a single plot's theme using theme(); see theme_update() if you want modify the active theme, to affect all subsequent plots.
Use the themes available in complete themes if you would like to use a complete theme such as theme_bw(), theme_minimal(), and more.
