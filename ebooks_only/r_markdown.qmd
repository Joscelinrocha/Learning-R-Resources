## [Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

By [Yihui Xie](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This short book introduces an R
package, bookdown, to change your workflow of writing books.
It should be technically easy to write a book, visually
pleasant to view the book, fun to interact with the book,
convenient to navigate through the book, straightforward for
readers to contribute or leave feedback to the book
author(s), and more importantly, authors should not always
be distracted by typesetting details.

## [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’¯

By [Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, Emily
Riederer](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This book aims to draw together
popular posts from Stack Overflow and other online resources
(such as blog posts or tutorials) to provide up-to-date
solutions for everyday queries that users commonly make. In
fact, to help us make decisions on the potential topics to
cover in this book, the second author of this book,
Christophe, has built an R Markdown dashboard to scrape
Stack Overflow daily for the most popular posts. Hopefully,
our cookbook can become more useful by including recipes
from these popular posts.
