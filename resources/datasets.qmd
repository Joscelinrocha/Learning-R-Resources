After I learned to do some fun things in R, I noticed that I needed datasets to practice my new skills.
I know there are some already built in R (added a nice list here) but I also wanted to "choose" something that aligns more with what I do or may enjoy learning about, so here are other ones I found too.

## [Child and Familia Data Archive (Beta)](https://www.childandfamilydataarchive.org/cfda/pages/cfda/index.html;jsessionid=5F851109CAC306B544741D5B55CC276F)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** The Child and Family Data Archive (C&F Data Archive) is the place to discover, access, and analyze data on young children, their families and communities, and the programs that serve them.

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site here:** The mission of Papers with Code is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, and evaluation tables.
We believe this is best done together with the community, supported by NLP and ML.
All content on this website is openly licenced under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia) and everyone can contribute - look for the "Edit" buttons!
We also operate specialized portals for papers with code in astronomy, physics, computer sciences, mathematics and statistics.
