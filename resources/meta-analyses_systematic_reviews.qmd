## [How to perform a Bayesian meta-analysis](https://www.dsquintana.blog/how-to-perform-a-bayesian-meta-analysis-in-r/)

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** Bayesian meta-analysis is uncommon, probably due
to a historical lack of accessible software options for performing these
tests. So in this post I'm going to outline the benefits of Bayesian
meta-analysis and a step-by-step guide (with code) on to perform one
using the relatively new "RoBMA" R package.

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from ebook:** This guide shows you how to conduct
meta-analyses in R from scratch. The focus of this guide is primarily on
clinical outcome research in psychology. It was designed for staff and
collaborators of the Protect Lab, which is headed by Prof. Dr. David D.
Ebert.

## [Workshop: A Practical Guide for Meta-Analyses in R](https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/)

By [Constantin Yves
Plessen](https://constantinyvesplessen.com/post/workshop_meta_analysis/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from site:** This blogpost is an adaption from my 90 minute
workshop on all basic steps in conducting a meta-analysis in R. The
audience of the original workshop were graduate psychology students at
the University of Vienna with a focus on research methods. Most
statistical and methodical elements were already discussed, yet the
implementation in R was new to all of them. And programming in general
was new to most of them. I therefore introduced R very shortly, before
explaining the actual meta-analytical analyses more briefly. I added
some explanations and references to make the file more self-explanatory
for independent study. Therefore, this post also contains materials and
references on how to install R, R Studio, and some basic concepts of
programming.
