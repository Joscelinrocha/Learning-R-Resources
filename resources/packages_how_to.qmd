## [Create your own R package-R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)

By [Hadley Wickham Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from e-book:** Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this book you'll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn't matter if your first version isn't perfect as long as the next version is better.

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** While there exist many great resources for learning how to write a package in R, we found it difficult to find one all-encompassing guide that is also easily accessible for beginners. This tutorial seeks to close this gap: we will provide you with a step-by-step guide --- seasoned with new and helpful packages that are also inspired by presentations at the recent virtual European R Users Meeting [e-Rum 2020](https://2020.erum.io/).

**What is this?**\
**Excerpt from site:** Writing a package sounds big - and it can for sure be. But in its simplest form, it\'s not that much more than putting a function in a package structure. The R community is great and came up with multiple great helpers that make your life easier!

## [Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)

By [Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)

**What is this?**

**Excerpt from blog:** This tutorial is not about making a beautiful, perfect R package. This tutorial is about creating a bare-minimum R package so that you don't have to keep thinking to yourself, "I really should just make an R package with these functions so I don't have to keep copy/pasting them like a goddamn luddite." Seriously, it doesn't have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time. (n.b. this is my attitude about all reproducibility)
